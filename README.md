# [OldSchool RuneScape Pricewatcher](https://djkean.github.io/pricewatcher/)

Pricewatcher is a tool made to track live prices for all tradeable items in the iconic game, OldSchool Runescape. Using [OldSchool RuneScape Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki)'s APIs, Any item you can buy or sell is tracked and recorded in 5 minute intervals, with high and low prices or trade volume for each timestamp also recorded and graphed for an easy to understand experience. View any item's trade patterns over the last 24 hours and observe the nuances of live trading in action! 

To use Pricewatcher, head to the Items page and browse thousands of items, or search for a specific item to view notable statistics regarding it's value and trade patterns. If you wish to keep tabs on any specific item(s), make use of the "favourite" system, a way to bookmark multiple items for fast access.

The inspiration for Pricewatcher came from the OldSchool Wiki team's own tool, [prices.runescape.wiki](https://prices.runescape.wiki/osrs/). A great and helpful tool for people both interested in the game or, even just statistics and data. It's a tool I've used a lot for many reasons and I wanted to try making my own in order to understand what goes into the process of collecting and interpreting data. This project helped me realize my interest in developing tools that can compliment things we already know and use, with the intent to offer quality of life improvements.

The React portion of Pricewatcher is considered complete, though I do have some Node related ideas I'd like to implement should I ever revisit this project in the future. (Opt-in Notifications for notable market changes, new items, etc)
