# [Pricewatcher](https://djkean.github.io/pricewatcher/)

Pricewatcher is a project I pursued as a way to learn React a way that tied in to my interests outside of education. It was exciting to create something that myself and others would find practical use for.
The idea was to create a website to track the price and volume of every item bought/sold on Oldschool Runescape, using a graphing library to display values and trends in a meaningful way.

To use Pricewatcher, visit the Items tab where you can search and browse for any item able to be sold. For more detailed information, select any item to view graphs detailing their recent trends in price and volume. There's also a Favourites tab where you can view all items you've favourited in one place, so you don't need to search up the same items multiple times.

In the future I look forward to creating a back-end for the project, allowing users to mark target prices for specific items, and create a system that will notify them when that item rises or falls to their marked price. The goal is a quick, intuitive website for people to track trends without needed to commit time playing the game.

Pricewather's React portion is complete, and part of my learning experience with [Get Coding](https://www.get-coding.ca).
In the near future I look forward to improving on this project via Node + MySQL.

This project uses: 
- OldSchool RuneScape's [Real-time Prices API](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices)
- [Recharts Graphing Library](https://recharts.org/en-US/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
