# Pricewatcher

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The current idea behind this project is to create a website for Oldschool Runescape that tracks any item, how much it sold for and how many were sold at any time.

In the future I will also be looking to add the ability to bookmark an item and a set price, and have the site notify you when that item reach said price - for the purpose of being able to take advantage of highs and lows without having to continually watch an item's trends.

This project is work-in-progress and part of my learing experience with [Get Coding](https://www.get-coding.ca).
